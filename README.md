# MultiplicativePersistence
Here are some methods to determine the mathematical persistence of a given integer. As an exercise, I look to benchmark my algorithms with integers containing more than 20,000 digits.

Below is an article describing some methods to look for a number with a multiplicative persistence of more than 11 (the current record holder).

I will be using the GMP library to search for such a number.
